The data will range from structured to unstructured. 
This isn't a binary classification, but a continuum.
Datasets can be broadly classified into 3 types/categories:
- <u>Structured </u>
	- Follows a particular fixed schema
	- [[Examples#Public datasets]]
- <u>Semi-Structured</u>
	- A schema exists but is not fixed
	- JSON files, XML files
	- [[Examples#Semi-Structured Datasets]]
- <u>Unstructured</u>
	- People work to convert this to structured
	- No structure at all
	- [[Examples#Unstructured Datasets]]
