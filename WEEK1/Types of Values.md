Each dataset will have different types of values that each attribute can take
We can broadly bucket them into 3 categories:

# Categorical
- Allows fewer computations
- List, sort but not more than that
- [[Examples#Categorical Values]]

# Numerical
- Can perform series of operations
- Add, multiply, take ratios, etc
- [[Examples#Numerical Values]]

# Composite
- Even more operations can be performed
- formed by a combination of multiple values
- [[Examples#Composite Values]]
